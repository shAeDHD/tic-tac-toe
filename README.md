Tic-Tac-Toe

This document contains a general explanation and operational guide of the 'Tic-Tac-Toe' General Assembly Project, which, from here on in, will be referred to as GA-TTT. GA-TTT is a project where a week is given to new coding students to create an interactive, web-based, game of Tic-Tac-Toe that could correctly determine when one of two players had successfuly won - or when a tie had eventuated.   

GA-TTT was created using the following tech: 
/-JS 
/-HTML 
/-CSS
/-JQuery 

At time of print, the following are known bugs:
/-Images not revealed on Tied Game. 
/-Scaling not appropriate for all screen sizes.
/-No reset feature, reloading of page necessary to play game again. 

I think, if I was to particiapte in this project again, I would have taken more time to refactor my code and tried to spend less time on .CSS elements - .CSS elements can be very time consuming and at the end of the day I still did not end up with a look that I was satisfied with. 



To finish the project, I would have liked to add the 'other' version of the game: a version of Tic-Tac-Toe skinned to look like the trench run scene in Star Wars: A New Hope. Specifically 'X' being player One as Luke Skywalker and 'O' being player Two as Darth Vadar. Each having different game-log dialogue lines from the film (Vadar, "I have you now", etc.), and their X and O symbols replaced with an outline stencil of the X-Wing and Advanced-Tie-Fighter, respectively, targeting systems - then when a win is achieved, these three outlines are animated to align over each other in the center square of 3, achieving a fully formed taget of the opponent's spaceship.
